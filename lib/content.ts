I further enabled customization by creating a dedicated pathway for modifying the position and size of contract signatures, all while preserving the original server files. My meticulous attention to detail was reflected in rigoroustesting routines, ensuring impeccable document integrity.`,
      `Developed a dynamic filter function for the website to refine product installment contract details. The function offered advanced search options including customer name, ID number, phone number, payment date, and contract status. The system was designed to extract 'Confirmed' contract data from the database and update the display status on the website as per the documented contract status. In cases of undefined status, the system defaulted to 'Active'.`,
      `Tasked with implemented Deep Link navigation, ensuring a seamless transition from the website's application download page to the designated mobile application as per assigned workflows and requirements. Initiated and oversaw the enhancement and revision of the product installment registration page. Furthermore, I developed robust APIs to fully support the product installment registration process, in addition to APIs designed for product recommendations.`,
